title: Competition & Antitrust Policy
---
Before starting my PhD, I worked as an antitrust economist at the Federal Economic Competition Commission ([COFECE](https://www.cofece.mx/?lang=en)) in Mexico. This experience not only provided me with valuable insights into the field but also awakened my passion for topics related to Economic Competition & Antitrust Policy, particularly in areas such as market regulation, antitrust enforcement, and policy development.

In this section, I will share publicly available information on cases I had the opportunity to work on during my tenure at COFECE, as well as new cases that I find particularly interesting. I will direct you to COFECE's analyses, and, when applicable, I will also reference papers relevant to each case.
